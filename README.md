An interactive playground to **draw your own 2D dataset** and **visually explore how machine learning classifiers work** – in real-time and right inside a Jupyter Notebook!

## 🔍 What is this?

This project uses the [drawdata](https://pypi.org/project/drawdata/) Python library, which allows you to **draw any 2D dataset by hand** directly in a notebook using your mouse.

As you draw, you can choose from a list of classifiers (Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, KNN, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, XGBoost, AdaBoost) and instantly see how the decision boundary changes based on the data!

Perfect for:
- ML beginners 🐣
- Teaching & learning machine learning intuitively 👨‍🏫
- Understanding model behavior visually 🧠

## 📦 Features

  - Logistic Regression
  - Support Vector Machines (poly & rbf)
  - K-Nearest Neighbors
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
  - Naive Bayes
  - AdaBoost
  - XGBoost
- Clean UI with `ipywidgets`
- No setup required beyond installing the dependencies
